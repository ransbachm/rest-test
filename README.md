# th-eshop
Project which aims to implement a online shop. \
*Not meant for actual use!*

Setup:
1. Create a database "th_eshop" in a mariadb instance
2. Copy .env.example -> .env and fill out (dev_mode=false for production)
3. Import ddl from sql folder 
4. Make sure python & libraries (py/requirements.txt) are installed

Common pitfalls:
- Sample data does not include pictures for now.
- Error messages are confusing / non-existant.
